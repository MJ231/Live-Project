# Live Project

## Introduction
In the last two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked with my peers in a team, developing and updating a full scale Theatre Website in C#. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product. I worked on several [back end stories](#back-end-stories) that I am very proud of. Because much of the site had already been built, there were also a good deal of [front end stories](#front-end-stories). Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories. Over the two week sprint I also had the opportunity to work on some other project management and team programming [skills](#other-skills-learned) that I'm confident I will use again and again on future projects.
